# Data Visualization using Tableau
### Since tableau is not a free software, all the Visualization will be shown here itself with the help of screen shots.
#
#
## Data Source
### Data is taken for Karnataka only from : http://data.icrisat.org/dld/src/crops.html 
#
#
## Features:
### 1.) Year
### 2.) District Name
### 3.) Sugarcane area (1000ha)
### 4.) Sugarcane yield (kg per ha)
### 5.) Sugarcane production (1000 tons)
#
#
## Objective:
### Create different charts, graphs, dashboards, and stories for visualizing and analyzing data.
#
#
## Before analysing, let us know about the data: 
#### Import the data.

#### From the status bar we get to know that there are 30 districts.
#### To make further process easier, let us introduce color for each of the district.

#### Thus, the data is available from the year 1990 - 2017.
### Whether the data from the year 1990 - 2017 is available for all the 30 districts?
#### We can answer it using two methods of visualization.

##### Note: Above, there are two types of visualization, where I haven't shown it completely. In tableau, you can see if you scroll down.
#### The following districts do not have the complete data from the year 1990 - 2017:

### Which district has larger area for the production of Sugarcane?

#### Belgaum has the larger area for the production of Sugarcane with 4157000 ha of land.

#### Mandya has greater yield with 313510 kg per ha when compaired to other districts.

#### When area is considered along, we can see that some of the districts has larger yield with lesser production area. 
#### Now consider distric wise. 
### 1.) Bagalkote:

#### There is reduction in yield though there is a change in the amount of area.
